**EmployeeRatings_README**

**Project Title:** Employee Ratings

**Description:** A Python program designed for managing employee ratings. Users can view current employee ratings, enter new ratings for employees, save input to a JSON file, and exit the program. The script includes classes for representing employee data, reading from and writing to JSON files, and managing user interactions. 

**Installation Instructions:** Python3, git it. 

**Usage Instructions:** main.py

**Examples:**

Show Current Ratings: select menu_choice 1 from the menu to display the current ratings of all employees.
Enter New Ratings: select menu_choice 2 to input new employee rating data. The script will prompt for the employee's first name, last name, date, and review rating.
Save Data: select menu_choice 3 to save the data to EmployeeRatings.json.
Exit Program: select menu_choice 4 to exit the program.

**Configuration:** The script uses EmployeeRatings.json as the default data file to read from and write to. Ensure this file is present in the same directory as the script or it will be created when saving data.
