Project Title: Employee Ratings

Description: This Python script is designed for managing employee ratings. It allows users to view current employee ratings, enter new ratings, save the data to a JSON file, and exit the program. It includes classes for representing employee data, reading from and writing to JSON files, and managing user interactions. 

Installation Instructions: Python3 required

Usage Instructions: main.py

Examples: 

**Show Current Ratings**
Select option 1 from the menu to display the current ratings of all employees.
**Enter New Ratings**
Select option 2 to input new employee rating data. The script will prompt for the employee's first name, last name, review date (in YYYY-MM-DD format), and review rating (an integer between 1 and 5).
**Save Data**
Select option 3 to save the entered or existing data to EmployeeRatings.json.
**Exit Program**
Select option 4 to exit the program.

Configuration: The script uses EmployeeRatings.json as the default data file to read from and write to. Ensure this file is present in the same directory as the script or it will be created when saving data.
